# YouTube API v3 PHP Wrapper & YouTube Downloader

A basic PHP wrapper for the Youtube Data API v3 ( Non-OAuth ). Designed to let devs easily fetch public data (Video & Channel) from Youtube. No 3rd party dependancy. The reason of returning the ARRAY response directly is to keep it simple.

Some parameters are missing in this library, because I don't need them at this point, if you desire a particular feature please file an issue here :smile:

## Requirements

* PHP >=7.2 || >=8.0
* CURL extension in PHP
* JSON extension in PHP

## Youtube Data API v3

* [Obtain API key from Google API Console](https://code.google.com/apis/console)
